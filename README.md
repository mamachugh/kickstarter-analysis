# Kickstarting with Excel

## Project Overview 
Determine successful characteristics for U.S. plays with a goal of $10,000 in funding. 

## Analysis and Challenges
### Overview
Identify specific factors for a successful crowdfunding campaign. This report includes several resources including a link to the Excel data set. Embedded charts were used to more easily visualize the data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
The first chart clearly indicates the best month to launch a campaign is May. Similarly, June through August may be acceptable, but 1st and 4th quarters are risky.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Campaigns of $10,000 - $15,000 have a 54% success rate. That is more than double the goal of the most successful campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

To have the best chance of completing a successful campaign, it is suggested the campaign is launched in May and the goal is reduced by more than half. It would be interesting to get data on the outcomes of the plays themselves to determine if more popular plays were better funded. 


<!--
1.3.1 FINDING: If we filter for only the United States campaigns, we will find that there were 525 successful theater Kickstarters.
1.3.2 FINDING: We have found that while there are only a total of 604 Kickstarter campaigns for plays in Great Britain, the "theater" category is the most successful.
1.3.3 FINDING: The month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July and October all had roughly the same number of failed campaigns launched. This can be determined by examining the points along the trend lines of the chart. As you hover over each point with your mouse pointer, a tooltip appears with the corresponding information.
